1. **Initialization:**
   - The project begins with the initialization of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   - The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the structure of the web page, including form elements for booking and cancellation, as well as a table to display current bookings.
   - The CSS file (`styles.css`) styles the HTML elements to improve the visual appearance and layout of the page.
   - The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the logic to handle form submissions, manage bookings, and update the user interface dynamically.

2. **Customer Booking:**
   - Customers visit the web page and fill out the booking form.
   - They enter their name, select the number of people, choose a preferred time slot, and select a table number.
   - JavaScript code listens for form submission events and captures the booking details entered by the customer.
   - It generates a unique booking ID for the reservation and stores the booking details in the local storage of the browser.

3. **Table Availability:**
   - The JavaScript code checks the availability of tables for the selected time slot by querying the existing bookings stored in local storage.
   - It disables already booked tables in the dropdown list to prevent double booking.

4. **Booking Confirmation:**
   - After successful booking, the system displays a confirmation alert to the customer, showing the generated booking ID.
   - The booking ID serves as a reference for the customer to manage or cancel their booking later.

5. **Booking Management:**
   - Staff members have access to view and manage current bookings.
   - They can see the table displaying all current bookings, including the table number and time slot.
   - The system dynamically updates the table to reflect any changes in bookings, such as new bookings or cancellations.

6. **Cancellation Facility:**
   - Customers who wish to cancel their booking enter their booking ID in the cancellation form.
   - JavaScript code listens for form submission events and searches for the booking corresponding to the entered ID.
   - If the booking is found, it is removed from the local storage, and a confirmation alert is displayed to the customer.
   - If the booking ID is invalid or not found, an error alert is displayed.

7. **User Interface Updates:**
   - The user interface is updated dynamically in response to user actions, such as booking, cancellation, or selecting a different time slot.
   - The table displaying current bookings is refreshed to reflect the latest booking information stored in local storage.
