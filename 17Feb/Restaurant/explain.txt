1. `DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener:
   - This event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
   - It ensures that the JavaScript code inside the event listener will only execute after the DOM is fully loaded.

2. `form`, `timeSlotSelect`, and `tableNoSelect`:
   - These variables store references to the booking form, time slot select element, and table number select element, respectively.
   - They are used to handle form submission and update table availability based on the selected time slot.

3. `bookings`:
   - This variable stores the existing bookings retrieved from local storage, or an empty object if there are no bookings yet.

4. `timeSlotSelect` Change Event Listener:
   - This event listener triggers whenever the selected time slot changes.
   - It calls the `updateTableAvailability` function to update the table availability based on the selected time slot.

5. `form` Submit Event Listener:
   - This event listener triggers when the booking form is submitted.
   - It collects form data, generates a booking ID, stores booking details in local storage, and displays a confirmation alert.

6. `generateBookingId` Function:
   - This function generates a random alphanumeric string to serve as a unique booking ID.

7. `storeBookingDetails` Function:
   - This function stores booking details in local storage under the 'bookings' key.

8. `updateTableAvailability` Function:
   - This function updates the table availability dropdown based on the selected time slot.
   - It disables already booked tables for the selected time slot.

9. `getBookedTables` Function:
   - This function retrieves a list of tables that are already booked for a given time slot.

10. `cancelBookingForm` and `cancelBooking`:
   - These variables and functions handle the cancellation of bookings.
   - They listen for the submission of the cancel booking form, delete the corresponding booking from local storage, and display a confirmation alert.

11. `populateCurrentBookingsTable` Function:
   - This function populates the table displaying current bookings.
   - It retrieves existing bookings from local storage and dynamically generates table rows to display the table number and time slot for each booking.

12. `populateCurrentBookingsTable` Invocation:
   - This line invokes the `populateCurrentBookingsTable` function to initially populate the current bookings table when the page loads.

Overall, this code manages the booking form, updates table availability, handles booking submission and cancellation, and displays current bookings in a table. It utilizes event listeners, functions, and local storage to provide a functional booking system.
