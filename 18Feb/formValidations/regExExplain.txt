\S+: This part matches one or more non-whitespace characters. \S is a shorthand character class that represents any non-whitespace character. The + quantifier specifies that the preceding \S should match one or more times, ensuring that there is at least one non-whitespace character before the @ symbol.

@: This part simply matches the @ symbol literally.

\S+: Similar to the first part, this matches one or more non-whitespace characters after the @ symbol. This ensures that there is at least one non-whitespace character after the @ symbol.

\.: This part matches a period (.) character literally. The backslash (\) before the period is an escape character to treat the period as a literal character. In regular expressions, a period without an escape character matches any single character except for a newline. Here, we're specifically matching the period character.

\S+: This matches one or more non-whitespace characters after the period (.), ensuring that there is at least one non-whitespace character after the period.

So, altogether, the regular expression \S+@\S+\.\S+ matches strings that have the following pattern:

One or more non-whitespace characters (\S+)
Followed by an @ symbol
Followed by one or more non-whitespace characters (\S+)
Followed by a period (.)
Followed by one or more non-whitespace characters (\S+)
