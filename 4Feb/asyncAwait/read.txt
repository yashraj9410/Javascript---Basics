The use of async/await in JavaScript is primarily driven by the need to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and synchronous-like manner.
 JavaScript is single-threaded and non-blocking, which means that it can efficiently handle asynchronous tasks without blocking the execution of other code. 
 Here are some key reasons for using async/await:

Readability:

Asynchronous code written using callbacks or promises can become difficult to read and maintain, especially as the complexity of the code increases. 
async/await provides a more readable and structured syntax, making it easier to understand the flow of asynchronous code.
Synchronous-Like Syntax:

async/await allows developers to write asynchronous code in a style that resembles synchronous code. This can make it easier for developers
 who are more accustomed to synchronous programming paradigms.

Error Handling:

Handling errors in asynchronous code can be challenging with traditional approaches. async/await simplifies error handling by using traditional
 try-catch blocks, making it more straightforward and consistent with synchronous error handling.
