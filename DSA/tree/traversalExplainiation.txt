Binary Tree:
A binary tree is a special type of tree in which each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Properties:
Each node has at most two children.
The left child is smaller than its parent, and the right child is greater than its parent (for binary search trees).
Not all levels may be fully filled, but nodes are filled from left to right.
Types of Binary Trees:
Binary Search Tree (BST): In a BST, the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater than the parent. This facilitates efficient searching and sorting operations.

Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as left as possible.

Full Binary Tree: A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

Traversal Techniques:
Traversal refers to visiting all the nodes of a tree in a specific order. There are three main traversal techniques for binary trees:

Preorder Traversal: Visit the root node first, then recursively visit the left subtree, and finally recursively visit the right subtree.

Inorder Traversal: Recursively visit the left subtree, then visit the root node, and finally recursively visit the right subtree. In a BST, this yields nodes in sorted order.

Postorder Traversal: Recursively visit the left subtree, then recursively visit the right subtree, and finally visit the root node.

Now, let's proceed with implementing a binary tree and these traversal techniques in JavaScript.
